        <h1>Enjoyment in the Shudder's Timing - Romantic Draft Chapter 3</h1>
        <p>
            In the beginning of this cloudy season,<br>
            There's a huge rise in two lives of me and her.<br>
            We were intended to sit behind everyone,<br>
            So we won't be a highlighted one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scattering of numerous<br>
            thunder claps making<br>
            us intended to cram;<br>
            together at the back,<br>
            While we were sitting aside<br>
            at our left and right-hand side.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cloudy vision seems to be a little blurry,<br>
            Unlike the vision I intended for us in my imaginary.<br>
            I was really joyed by the thought of cramming with her.
        </p>
        <p>
            While in the meantime lightning strike,<br>
            Her expressions were such a stunning type;<br>
            While she was so scared right this time,<br>
            She holds my hand a bit tight.<br>
            I was so afraid by this time;<br>
            Though her every little shudder became calm<br>
            With the hand of someone's mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the light of the classroom is on off duty,<br>
            I intend to start my own duty;<br>
            Of giving a hurricane ride<br>
            to the forlorn heart of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the thunder was clapping so fast;<br>
            The beat of our heart is rising as cautious as the level of blast.<br>
            Though the graph of our heart beat kept rising;<br>
            Still we're enjoying this as some anime's story lining.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we aren't talking much,<br>
            Our eyes were more than enough.<br>
            For those couples of thunder claps,<br>
            We became more than just friends.<br>
            Now, with every roaring of this thunder,<br>
            Our relation starts to rise as the morning sun.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aren't allowing our mind to realize<br>
            What is happening with our heart this time.<br>
            We're just giggling loud<br>
            To neutralize our surround,<br>
            So our heart won't mount.<br>
            As we're showing we aren't aware<br>
            of what our heart is intended to make;<br>
            It's just right now we aren't prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
            While there's a lot happening<br>
            In this thunder's timing.<br>
            Our enjoyment aligns with the shudder's timing.
