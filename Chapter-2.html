        <h1>Harmony's Quest: Two Halves - Romantic Draft Chapter 2</h1>
        <p>
            The dream of uniting two halves<br>
            seems quite difficult to be caught off guard,<br>
            though I'm aware it's perfectly aligned;<br>
            Us to get unite.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I'm the dark moon at night,<br>
            I need her rays of the sun every second of time<br>
            to brighten this obscure night.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she's the bright moon of this dark night,<br>
            I intend to be that one star<br>
            of this starless night.<br>
            Together we can beautify this spooky night.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she's the magician,<br>
            I intend to be the wand.<br>
            If she casts the spells,<br>
            I intend to be the first word of her.<br>
            It's more like we are<br>
            enchanted by the spells of Held-together.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she's a writer,<br>
            I intend to be a paper,<br>
            so our relationship can be written forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she's a waterfall,<br>
            I intend to be a mountain.<br>
            Together we can create such a gorgeous pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she likes to roam around,<br>
            I intend to be a big greenery ground,<br>
            so I can work as oxygen in this hazardous taint that is around.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she likes the shooting stars,<br>
            I intend to drag them at the beautiful hands of her.<br>
            By the single touch of her,<br>
            stars found to gain consciousness as the nightly moonflower.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she likes to sing,<br>
            I intend to be the instrument of her every music,<br>
            so the rhythmic<br>
            of ours can be live as the legacies.
        </p>
        <p>
            If she likes something,<br>
            I intend to be the part of that something,<br>
            so it might bring a little giggling.<br>
            I always try to be the reason for her smile,<br>
            so I won't be a bunch of regrets at the end of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Us is like a missing piece<br>
            of our puzzling grace,<br>
            and I'm pursuing that missing piece<br>
            as my heart pace.<br>
            It's more like we're<br>
            the two points on a page<br>
            who can form a well-defined line.<br>
            Once we're linked, our destinies align.
        </p>
        <p>
            Us is like the two halves of a single line,<br>
            which is waiting to unite.<br>
            Her one smile can fix the void of mine,<br>
            while if I find her this time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm on my way to seek for the<br>
            smile of her and mine,<br>
            so we can enjoy this time...
