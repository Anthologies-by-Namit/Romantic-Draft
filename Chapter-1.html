        <h1>Wandering in the Spring's Spell - Romantic Draft Chapter 1</h1>
        <p>
            In the time of spring,<br>
            she was wandering around<br>
            outside the place of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was seeking for her sight;<br>
            her one sight is enough to make me so high
            <br>as the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her eyes were like stars,<br>
            twinkling high in the sky of midnight.
            <br>Her eyes on me make me faint<br>
            so hard, like a Fittonia flower.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her voice is pleasant as<br>
            the sound of the Nightingale,<br>
            enough to enchant the ear of this daydreamer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her hair is like wet leaves,<br>
            always shining and<br>
            reflects the future of us;<br>
            When we meet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her giggle carries the potential<br>
            to make the surroundings bloom.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of this pollution,<br>
            her presence works as the oxygen of this daydreamer.
        </p>
        <p>
            She doesn't talk much,<br>
            though she does a lot in my dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            She doesn't know how to play,<br>
            though she plays with my heart well.
        </p>
        <p>
            She doesn't believe in angels,<br>
            though she's the one.
        </p>
        <p>
            She doesn't think that she's beautiful,
            <br>though she never saw my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            She doesn't believe in magic,<br>
            though she possesses it generously.<br>
            She doesn't know how to cast spells,<br>
            though I'm already in her control.<br>
            It was more like she has a magical wand,
            <br>and I'm wandering for her.
        </p>
        <p>
            She is the moon,<br>
            glowing in this darkness.<br>
            I want to be that one star,<br>
            of this starless night.
        </p>
