        <h1>Shattering Echoes - Romantic Draft Chapter 5</h1>
        <p>
            Wasn't sure that miracles transpire<br>
            till it takes place in our life.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of dizzy time,<br>
            I was on a way of hope;<br>
            to find such place<br>
            that called home.<br>
            Though someone else<br>
            find out my heart's bolthole.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our way was aligned by God's grace;<br>
            Destined to fulfil our heart's lone.
        </p>
        <p>
            She ran into me erroneously by fate;<br>
            We were found awkward for inceptive,<br>
            however, our lone hearts found to be<br>
            delighted by coziness that felt for first time.<br>
            That was our first talk exchange,<br>
            whose echoes even shatter after our grave.
